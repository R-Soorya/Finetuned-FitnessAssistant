# Model Card for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct Fine-Tuned with LoRA Weights

This model is a fine-tuned version of the "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct" using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) weights. 
It was trained to assist in answering questions and providing information on a range of topics. 
The model is designed to be used with the ðŸ¤— Hugging Face transformers library

## Model Details

### Model Description

This model is based on the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct architecture and has been fine-tuned with LoRA weights to improve its performance on specific downstream tasks. It was trained on a carefully selected dataset to enable more focused and contextual responses. The model is designed to perform well in environments where GPU resources may be limited, using optimizations like FP16 and device mapping.

- **Developed by:**  Soorya R
- **Model type:** Causal Language Model with LoRA fine-tuning
- **Language(s) (NLP):** Primarily English
- **License:** Model card does not specify a particular license; check the base model's license on Hugging Face for usage guidelines.
- **Finetuned from model:** meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct

## Uses

### Direct Use

This model can be directly used for general-purpose question-answering and information retrieval tasks in English. 
It is suitable for chatbots and virtual assistants and performs well in scenarios where contextual responses are important.

### Downstream Use 

The model may also be further fine-tuned for specific tasks that require conversational understanding and natural language generation.

### Out-of-Scope Use

This model is not suitable for tasks outside of general-purpose NLP.
It should not be used for high-stakes decision-making, tasks requiring detailed scientific or legal knowledge, or applications that could impact user safety or privacy.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

This model was fine-tuned on a curated dataset but still inherits biases from the underlying Llama model.
Users should be cautious about using it in sensitive or biased contexts, as the model may inadvertently produce outputs that reflect biases present in the training data.

### Recommendations

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the potential risks and limitations of the model, including biases in language or domain limitations.
More robust evaluation is recommended before deployment in critical applications.

## How to Get Started with the Model
